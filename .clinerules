# Code Quality Guidelines

1. Test coverage:
   - Always verify that code changes have test coverage before attempting completion.
   - Verify that all tests pass before submitting changes.

2. Lint rules:
   - Do not invalidate any lint rule without the explicit approval of the user.

3. Testing:
   - Follow the testing approach documented in the test implementation guide.
   - Use the "reverse-engineer from results" methodology.
   - Structure tests using the "When {situation}, performing {action} results in {outcome}" naming convention.
   - Implement tests using the 3A pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), starting with assertions first.

4. Git commits:
   - Commit changes to the repository.
   - Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
   - Commit frequently to create a clear history of development.

5. Reflection:
   - Upon task completion, conduct a reflection session.
   - Document the reflection in `docs/reflection.md`.
   - Include lessons learned, challenges faced, and potential improvements.
